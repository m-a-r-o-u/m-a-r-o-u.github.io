## CV

PhD-trained engineer focused on HPC/GPU platforms, research infrastructure, and production-grade scientific systems. I build reliable environments that help research teams move from ideas to reproducible results.

- **Focus:** Research infrastructure engineering, platform reliability, and scientific workload enablement.
- **Strengths:** Performance profiling, bottleneck analysis, and practical optimization roadmaps.
- **Leadership style:** Clear ownership, calm execution, and documentation-first collaboration.
- **Tooling:** Linux, HPC schedulers, reproducible pipelines, observability and automation workflows.
- **Mentorship:** Technical onboarding, internal tutorials, and bridging researcher/developer communication.

Selected interests: scalable AI/HPC operations, research workflow reproducibility, and systems that remain usable under real-world constraints.
